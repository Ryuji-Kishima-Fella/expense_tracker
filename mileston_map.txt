# 🧠 How This Becomes Your README

Your README sections will directly map to this:

```text
Features        → Milestones 1–6
Future Plans    → Milestones 7–8
Version History → Milestone versions
```

You already did this well with **Mood Tracker**, so this will feel familiar.

---

## ✅ Next Step (recommended)

Now that milestones are clear, the **next best move** is:

👉 **Write the README first (without code)**
I can help you draft it line-by-line.

If you want, say:

> “Help me write the README based on these milestones.”

And we’ll do it cleanly and professionally.
